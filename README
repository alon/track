A very old project using ODE to simulate a tracked vehicle mockup. The vehicle consists of:
 Large box - the interior
 Four Wheels with Teeth (I know there is a technical term for this), two on either side.
 Two Chains of Links that are setup around the wheels

param.dat controls many of the components.

Requirements:
 ODE 0.11 from sourceforge.

Build instructions:
 build and install it (./configure && make && sudo make install)
 Assuming ODE is the location of the source, create some symlinks:
  ln -sf $ODE/include/drawstuff .
  ln -sf $ODE/drawstuff/src/.libs/libdrawstuff.a .
  ln -sf $ODE/drawstuff/textures .
 make

Usage:
 # edit param.dat
 ./track
 The keyboard shortcuts are standard drawstuff stuff (and are printed to stdout).

TODO:
 * build a debian package, just for kicks
 * make it into a screensaver (the ultimate test)
 * blenderize it - make a blender python script to build this thing.
